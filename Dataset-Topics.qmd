1. Reading in API data
2. Parsing JSON
3. Scraping data from websites
4. Using appropriate graphics

```{r}
library(httr)
library(jsonlite)
library(tidyverse)

brew <- GET("https://api.openbrewerydb.org/v1/breweries")
```

Comments:

- Breweries don't have a standard website format, so this is likely to be a bit more challenging than you expect to get systematic data back out.

- What do you plan to do with the naming of breweries? What type of analysis/investigation can you do with that?


- A spatial analysis of whether breweries in similar areas/close proximity tend to specialize vs. compete might be interesting -- I have no idea if the data supports this or not. You could limit it to one or two cities known for having a ton of breweries, though?

- Do some digging to ensure that this data is relatively complete before you settle on it -- if only so that you can acknowledge the limitations of your dataset.
